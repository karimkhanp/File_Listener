This practical listens the changes in the file on system and generate log file to record the changes taken place in the file.


step0: Copy the file listen_update.c on your desktop
step1: Compile listern_Update.c
        gcc -o a listen_Update.c
step2: Run the file and listen to the changes taking place in particular directory
        ./a /home/technoworld/Desktop/tmp/
        // Please enter here path of the direcoty for which you want to listen
        // Suppose you excel file is in /tmp directory, then enter the path as above. Program will listen what ever changes occur in the directoris and files within /tmp


Like wise you can run listen_create_del_Mod, which will listen to file creation, deletion as well.
